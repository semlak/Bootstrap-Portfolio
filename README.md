# Bootstrap-Portfolio

This is a Portfolio-type site I developed to satisfy requirements for an deliverable for a course I'm taking. I plan to convert it to an actual professional portfolio website, but as it exists it is not ready.

The site is currently static with no server requirements beyond standard html/css/javascript delivery. It is styled with Bootstrap 4 to be responsive. The form in the contact.html page does not actually submit data.

Currently deployed via GitHub Pages at https://semlak.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/
